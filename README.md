ystem on Chip (SoC) allows million of transistors to be integrated on single chip. Traditional SoC has bus based architecture for communication which limits the processing speed. Now a days in Silicon industries there is emerging concept of Network on Chip (NoC) to decouple communication from computations. Router is a backbone of NoC, hence efficient design of router is essential to enhance the performance of the system. In present work, we focus on a router input- output protocol design. Proposed system includes virtual cut through mechanism for close loop communication. Router 1x3 has single input port and three output ports. Top-level architecture designed with sub- modules like FIFO, FSM, Synchronizer and Register using Verilog language.
